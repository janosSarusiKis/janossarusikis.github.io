# Building the Foundation: Implementing a Tile-Based World

Welcome back to my devlog series! In this post, I'll dive into the technical implementation of our tile-based world system. Creating a flexible and efficient tile system is crucial for our game, as it will serve as the foundation for everything from movement to the corruption system.

## The Need for Custom Tools

One of the first challenges I faced was the need for efficient map creation and modification. While Unity provides various built-in tools, I needed something specifically tailored to our game's requirements. This led me to develop a custom editor tool that would streamline the map creation process.

## Implementing the Tile System

### Basic Grid Generation
The first step was creating a basic grid generator. Here's what it does:
- Takes X and Y dimensions as input
- Generates a grid of tiles based on these dimensions
- Automatically places the initial tile prefabs

### Tile Properties and States
Each tile in our system needs to handle multiple states and properties:
- Walkable/non-walkable status
- Visual representation for different states
- Future support for corruption system variations

This multi-state approach will be particularly valuable when implementing the corruption system, as tiles will need to change their appearance based on corruption levels.

## Custom Editor Tools

To make the map creation process more efficient, I developed several custom editor features:

1. **Grid Editor Window**
   - Custom Unity editor window
   - Toggle grid visibility
   - Mouse-based tile editing
   - Visual feedback for selected tiles

2. **Tile State Editor**
   - Click-to-toggle walkable status
   - Visual indicators for non-walkable tiles
   - Real-time preview of changes

3. **Hover Highlighting**
   - Visual feedback for tile under mouse cursor
   - Helps with precise tile selection
   - Improves editor usability

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Editor State Persistence
One significant challenge was maintaining tile data when switching between Play and Edit modes in Unity. The solution involved:
- Properly serializing tile data
- Rebuilding the tile dictionary when returning to editor mode
- Ensuring consistent state management

### 2. Learning Custom Editor Windows
Creating custom editor windows was new territory for me. I had to learn:
- Unity's Editor GUI system
- Event handling in editor scripts
- Custom inspector development

### 3. AI-Assisted Development
While using AI tools for code generation and debugging:
- Quick solution generation was helpful
- Always needed to verify and validate suggested code
- Multiple solutions provided different perspectives

## Next Steps

As I continue developing the tile system, here are the immediate next steps:

1. **Enhanced Tile Variety**
   - Implement multiple tile types
   - Add tile swapping functionality
   - Create a tile palette system

2. **Player Integration**
   - Add basic player movement
   - Implement pathfinding system
   - Test movement constraints

## Technical Insights

A few key technical insights from this phase:
1. Keeping the tile system modular will help with future features
2. Editor tools are worth the initial time investment
3. Planning for future features (like corruption) early helps avoid major refactoring

## Closing Thoughts

Building these foundational systems has been both challenging and rewarding. While it might not be the most exciting part of game development, having robust tools and systems will make future development much smoother.

Stay tuned for the next update, where we'll explore implementing multiple tile types and basic pathfinding!
