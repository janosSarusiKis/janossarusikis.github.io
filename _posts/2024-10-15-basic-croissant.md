**Mastering laminated dough is a long process, but the result—flaky, buttery croissants—is totally worth the effort.** Like every adventure, our journey to making awesome croissants starts with one simple step: a basic recipe.

It may sound like heresy to some professional bakers, but for a proof-of-concept (POC) croissant, we don’t need to understand every detail. The goal is to simply create something, wake up our inner baker, and aim for a “good enough” result. Once we achieve that, we can start tweaking the recipe, refining our methods, and expanding our knowledge.

I’ve tested a simple yet effective recipe that can be a great starting point. It’s easy to make, and the end result is so delicious that my croissants tend to disappear the moment I bring them into the office!

*Disclaimer:* Even though this is a simplified recipe, it still takes two days to complete, as the dough needs time to rest and develop the flavors we want.

### Ingredients:

- **100g water**, **100g flour**, and **2g yeast** (for the poolish)
- **500g flour**
- **225g whole milk**
- **12g salt**
- **5g yeast**
- **45g sugar**
- **250g butter**

*Note:*  
You can use all-purpose flour or bread flour, whichever you prefer. Don’t get stuck on details—focus on the key points! I typically use instant dry yeast, which comes in small 7g packets, making it easy to measure for this recipe.

### Instructions:

#### 1. Making the Poolish

First, create the poolish. Combine **100g water**, **100g flour**, and **2g yeast** in a mixing bowl, then cover it. Let it sit for 2–4 hours (depending on room temperature) until it’s bubbly and has doubled in size. 

Poolish is a pre-fermentation method that gives your croissants a soft texture and a lovely aroma. It kickstarts gluten and flavor development early in the process.

#### 2. Preparing the Dough

When your poolish is ready, mix it with the rest of the ingredients **except the butter**. No need to knead at this stage. Just mix until the dough is homogenous, then cover it and let it rest for 30 minutes. 

*Tip:* Moving the dough to a clean bowl is optional but can help with later steps.

#### 3. Stretch and Fold

After 30 minutes, we begin the first stretch and fold. Grab the bottom of the dough, stretch it, and fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat. Continue until you’ve folded the dough all around.

Let the dough rest for another 30 minutes, then repeat the stretch-and-fold process two more times, with 30-minute rests in between.

Once done, roll the dough into a **30x40 cm** rectangle and chill it in the fridge for 2 hours.

#### 4. Making the Butter Block

After 1.5 hours, prepare the butter block. Arrange your **250g butter** on parchment paper in a rough rectangle. Fold the paper around it to create a **20x30 cm** block, then use a rolling pin to shape the butter. Put it back in the fridge until the dough is ready.

#### 5. Laminating the Dough

Now it’s time for the fun part—lamination! The key is to keep the dough and butter at similar cool temperatures to ensure the layers don’t break. 

Take both out of the fridge. Place the butter block in the center of your dough, then fold the sides of the dough over the butter to fully enclose it. Gently roll out the dough until it’s about **50-60 cm** long. Rotate it 90 degrees, then fold the dough into thirds like a letter. If the dough warms up, chill it for 10–15 minutes before continuing.

Repeat the folding process two more times, rolling out the dough to about **30x50 cm** before each fold.

*Need a visual aid?* [Here’s a helpful video on lamination](https://youtu.be/712xtDkLre0?t=72). The baker uses an industrial machine to roll the dough, but the folding technique is the same.

#### 6. Shaping the Croissants

After the final rest (at least one hour in the fridge), roll the dough out into a **25-30x60 cm** rectangle. Let it rest on the counter for a few minutes to prevent shrinkage when cutting. 

Cut the dough into 6–12 triangles, depending on your preferred croissant size. I usually cut 8, but feel free to experiment. Make a small cut at the base of each triangle, then roll them up tightly and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

#### 7. Final Rise and Baking

Give yourself a pat on the back for making it this far! Cover the croissants with plastic wrap or a bag and let them rest overnight in the fridge. In the morning, let them rise for 1.5–2 hours at room temperature, or until they’ve doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to **220°C (428°F)**. Brush the croissants with a beaten egg, and bake for **20–30 minutes** or until they’re golden brown. Be sure to check them regularly.
