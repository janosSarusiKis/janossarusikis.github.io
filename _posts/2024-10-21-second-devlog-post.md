# Laying the Foundation: Crafting My Game Design Document

Welcome back, fellow game enthusiasts! In this second entry of my devlog series, I'm excited to share the next crucial step in my game development journey: creating the Game Design Document (GDD). Let's dive into the world of Nierra and explore the foundations of what I hope will become an engaging and unique gaming experience.

## Why a Game Design Document?

Before we delve into the specifics, you might wonder: why start with a GDD? For me, the answer is twofold:

1. **Focus**: A GDD helps me concretize my ideas, providing a clear direction for development.
2. **Manageability**: By breaking down the game into digestible components, I hope to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the scope of the project.

Remember, a GDD is a living document. It will evolve as the game develops, but having this initial framework is invaluable.

## The World of Nierra

The setting for our game is born from my experiences as a Dungeon Master. Nierra is a country I created for my D&D campaigns, and it serves as the perfect backdrop for our game.

Picture this: The heroes have saved the day, but at a great cost. The land is scarred, many have perished, and the power structures have crumbled. It's in this chaotic era that our player will step in, shaping the future of Nierra.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

Now, let's break down the key pillars of our gameplay:

1. **Single Player Experience**: Focus on one character's journey through Nierra.

2. **3D World**: Bringing Nierra to life in three dimensions.

3. **Character-Centric**: Control one main character, with potential for indirect companion management later.

4. **Turn-Based Tactical Gameplay**: Each character takes one action per turn (move, attack, cast spell, use skill, etc.). This system allows for thoughtful, strategic gameplay.

5. **Tile-Based World**:
   - The country is divided into a grid of areas.
   - Each area is a separate scene in Unity.
   - Characters move one tile per turn, pacing the gameplay and emphasizing tactical decisions.

6. **Faction/Organization Management**:
   - Players can create and develop their own faction.
   - Build a faction base, recruit companions.
   - Send companions on missions to influence Nierra.

7. **World Alignment System (Corruption System)**:
   - A unique feature tracking the balance between good and evil.
   - Skills, events, and objects can spread corruption or radiate holy energy.
   - Visual representation: Tiles change appearance based on corruption levels (e.g., trees transitioning from lush to withered as corruption increases).

## Next Steps

With these pillars defined, my next task is to flesh out the GDD with more detailed mechanics, storyline elements, and character progression systems. I aim to keep it as concise as possible while providing enough detail to guide development.

The immediate next step after completing the GDD will be to start experimenting with tile-based maps in Unity. This will help me visualize the world of Nierra and begin to bring these concepts to life.

## Closing Thoughts

Creating this GDD is an exciting process. It's where imagination meets practicality, and where the game starts to take shape, even if only on paper (or in a digital document) for now.

Stay tuned for the next devlog entry, where we'll dive into the creation of our first tile-based maps in Unity. The journey from concept to code begins!

Happy gaming and developing!
