I’ve tried to start both blogging and game development multiple times, but consistency has always been an issue. Whether it was due to lack of time or just creative blocks, I struggled to maintain a routine. This time, I’m determined to approach things differently, focusing on progress, no matter how small, and staying committed to documenting my journey.

This blog will serve as a personal record of my game development experiences, as well as occasional recipe posts when inspiration strikes. By combining these two passions, I hope to create a space where I can track my growth and hold myself accountable.

Consistency has always been one of my greatest challenges in game development. Every time I started, something would come up, either time constraints, creative blocks, or other distractions. These repeated restarts taught me a lot about persistence, but they also left me feeling frustrated and stuck in a cycle of starting over.

Looking back, I realize that part of the problem was my approach. I often set high expectations and became discouraged when things didn’t go perfectly. Now, my focus is on making progress rather than achieving perfection. Each step, no matter how small, is a victory, and it's important to recognize that progress is progress, no matter the pace.

This time, I'm combining the two things: game development and blogging. The idea is to document my progress regularly, sharing what I’ve learned, what challenges I’ve faced, and how I’ve overcome them. By doing this, I’m creating a sense of accountability and also giving myself a place to reflect on the journey.

I know that staying consistent is key. This blog will serve as a way for me to check in with myself, track milestones, and keep moving forward. And when I feel creatively stuck or need a break, I'll switch gears and post some recipes to keep things fresh and interesting.

Full disclosure: When it comes to blogging, forming sentences and organizing thoughts can sometimes feel like a hurdle. To overcome these creative blocks, I’ve decided to make use of AI tools. They assist me in structuring my content and breaking down complex ideas into simpler, manageable pieces, making the process of writing smoother and more enjoyable.
My plan is to use it less and less as time pass by and I got more experience and posts behind my back.

Se you in the next one, cheers!
