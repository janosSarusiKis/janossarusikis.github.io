# From Fantasy Nerd to Aspiring Game Dev: My Journey Begins

Hello, fellow gamers and developers! Welcome to the first entry in my devlog series. I'm excited to share my journey into game development with you. But before we dive into the nitty-gritty of game creation, let's take a step back and explore the path that led me here.

## The Seeds of Fantasy

My love for fantasy worlds started in my teenage years. Like many before me, I was captivated by Tolkien's Middle-earth. The rich lore, the epic quests, and the intricate world-building ignited a passion that would shape my interests for years to come.

From there, I dove headfirst into Robert Jordan's "Wheel of Time" series, losing myself in its complex narrative and expansive universe. And of course, no fantasy journey would be complete without venturing into the realms of Dungeons & Dragons, where imagination truly knows no bounds.

## From Reader to Player

As my love for fantasy grew, so did my interest in video games. I found myself immersed in rich, story-driven worlds:

- The strategic depth of Warcraft
- The morally grey universe of The Witcher
- The vast, open worlds of The Elder Scrolls series (Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim)
- The D&D-inspired adventures in Neverwinter Nights

These games weren't just entertainment; they were gateways to new worlds, each one fueling my desire to create something of my own.

## The First Taste of Creation

My first foray into game creation came through the Warcraft 3 map editor. Suddenly, I wasn't just playing in these worlds – I was shaping them. Creating custom maps and campaigns gave me a taste of the creative power that game development could offer.

## From Player to Developer

My interest in computers naturally led me to become a software developer. While I enjoyed creating various applications, there was always a part of me that longed to return to those fantasy worlds I loved so much.

It was only a matter of time before the obvious next step presented itself: why not combine my programming skills with my passion for fantasy and gaming?

## Preparing for the Journey

Before diving in, I did what any aspiring game developer would do:

1. Watched countless YouTube tutorials
2. Read blog posts from experienced devs
3. Researched different game engines

Given my background in C#, Unity seemed like the natural choice. Its robust ecosystem and extensive documentation made it an attractive starting point.

## Choosing the Path Less Traveled

Now, here's where I may diverge from conventional wisdom. Most advice suggests starting with a simple game – something like Pong or a basic platformer. It's solid advice, aimed at helping newcomers learn the ropes without getting overwhelmed.

But that's not me.

I need a project that resonates with my passions, something I can pour my heart and soul into. I'm looking for a game idea that will keep me motivated through the inevitable challenges ahead.

## The Road Ahead

So, here I am, at the beginning of my game development journey. I have my programming skills, my love for fantasy, and a burning desire to create something unique.

In the coming posts, I'll share my progress, the challenges I face, and the lessons I learn along the way. I hope you'll join me on this adventure.

Until next time, when I drive into the Game Desing Documet!
